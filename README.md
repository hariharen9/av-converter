# üé¨ AV Converter

A powerful and user-friendly batch script for converting, manipulating, and inspecting media files using the power of FFmpeg. This script provides a simple command-line menu to perform common audio and video tasks without needing to memorize complex FFmpeg commands.

- **Lossy Conversion:** Re-encode video to reduce file size, with simple quality presets.
- **Video Trimming:** Cut a video by specifying a start and end time.
- **Audio Extraction:** Extract the audio from a video file into formats like MP3, FLAC, or WAV.
