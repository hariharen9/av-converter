# ðŸŽ¬ AV Converter

A powerful and user-friendly batch script for converting, manipulating, and inspecting media files using the power of FFmpeg. This script provides a simple command-line menu to perform common audio and video tasks without needing to memorize complex FFmpeg commands.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Action-Oriented Menu:** Select a file, then choose from a list of available actions.
- **File Inspection:** View detailed information about a media file, including resolution, duration, size, and stream details.
- **Lossless Conversion:** Change a file's container format (e.g., MKV to MP4) without re-encoding, preserving the original quality.
- **Lossy Conversion:** Re-encode video to reduce file size, with simple quality presets.
- **Video Trimming:** Cut a video by specifying a start and end time.
- **Audio Extraction:** Extract the audio from a video file into formats like MP3, FLAC, or WAV.
- **Audio Removal:** Create a silent version of a video by removing its audio track.
- **Batch Conversion:** Convert all video files in the directory to a specific format in one go.
